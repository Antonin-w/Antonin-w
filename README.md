## Hi there 👋

Here you can see some projects I've done along my bioinformatics journey:

- 🧬 [RNA seq analysis](https://github.com/Antonin-w/RNA_seq_analysis_LF) on cluster (Bash, DESeq2)
- 🛠️ [Creation of pipeline for CHIP-seq analysis](https://github.com/Antonin-w/CHIP_seq_analysis_Nextflow) running on cluster (Nextflow, Bash)
- 📊 [Visual representation of dataset](https://github.com/Antonin-w/Heart_Failure_Prediction_with_R) with ggplot2
- 🤖 [Machine learning](https://github.com/Antonin-w/Heart_Failure_Prediction_with_R) (Linear regression, Knn, Random Forest)
- 🐍 [Global and Local alignment algorithms implemented](https://github.com/Antonin-w/Alignement-sequence-Algo)

Moreover, besides these, I've also fully developped a variant calling pipeline with Nextlow, using Docker and AWS.
